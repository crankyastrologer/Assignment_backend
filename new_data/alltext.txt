Work/ Internship Experience

Space Systems Laboratory, IIIT-Delhi (June 2023 – Aug 2023)

I did my Intership in space system's laboratory in IIIT Delhi where I majorly dabbled in rehauling their website which included

Reworked the datapipeline for the website improving load times by upto 300% and eliminating hangups

Made front end more user friendly and added features like database search filtering along with different modes for relative positions of satellites

Created an server communicate between the supercomputer and the website regarding the collision probability

Assisted in the migration of atmospheric models to new platforms, ensuring seamless integration and functionality.

Designed and implemented an auto-updating MongoDB database system to streamline data management processes.

Projects

Twitter Disaster Detection

Leveraged TensorFlow and pandas to develop a natural language processing (NLP) model aimed at detecting tweets related to disasters.

The model analyzed tweet content to determine whether it pertained to a disaster scenario, aiding in early detection and response efforts during crises.

Reinforcement Learning

Implemented reinforcement learning models using Stablebaselines3 and Pytesseract on gaming environments such as Dino and Edge Surf.

These models were designed to learn optimal strategies and behaviors through trial and error, showcasing adaptability and learning capabilities in dynamic environments.

Iris Segmentation and Cryptography

Contributed to a project focused on iris segmentation from the CASIA dataset and subsequent image encryption.

Utilized Scikit-learn, OpenCV, and TensorFlow to accurately segment iris data, which was then employed in image encryption techniques to enhance data security and privacy measures.
